# pathfinder-visualizer
Visualizer for pathfinding algorithms (i.e. Dijkstra's, bfs, A*)

## Example
In this gif, I demonstrate the main functionality of the project:
* Picking start and end points by clicking on them
* Creating walls by clicking and dragging on squares
* Selecting the algorithm and speed
* Running the algorithm
